# DGMD-S17-Car_Colission_avoidance
We are developing an autonomous car prototype based on collision avoidance and route tracking using Deep Learning technology with this project. The robot car has a system based on JetBot Nano Car, with artificial intelligence (AI) oriented to the NVIDIA dashboard. Our JetBot can identify the road and various objects, and avoid them. We implemented experimental tests in a garage of a real house, and on a Lego track. For the recognition of images, it was first carried out through photographs and then using various elements (Legos (People, small cars, etc.), called obstacles for the System to recognize them. To achieve these objectives, we used the Deep Learning technique, self-Image evasion and recognition.
We train the robot to identify and learn from obstacles in an agile and fast way.
