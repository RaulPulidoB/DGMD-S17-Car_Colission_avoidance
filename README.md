# DGMD-S17-Car_Colission_avoidance
We are developing an autonomous car prototype based on collision avoidance and route following using Deep Learning technology with this project. The robot car has a System is based on a robot car, JetBot, with NVIDIA dash-oriented artificial intelligence (AI).  Our JetBot can identify various objects and avoid them. We implemented experimental tests in a garage of a real house. We created a track and took multiple pictures to recognition of the trail. For image recognition   It was first made through photographs and then using various elements (Legos (People, small cars, etc.), called obstacles for the System to recognize them. To achieve this, we used the Deep Learning technique, auto- Image avoidance, and recognition. We trained the robot to identify and learn from obstacles in an agile way quickly.
